After retrieval of code you will likely have to perform a NuGet Restore action.

In the Solution Explorer, right-click the Solution 'Pizza' (in this case) and select
		'Restore NuGet Packages'
Then proceed to build.

One thing to take note of is reference to the Pizzas.json file.  This may be stored on the Web or within a file or both.
See the notes within Program.cs for more information.
